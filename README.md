# RNN-Spanish-Government

This project contains Jupyter Notebooks that utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate Spanish texts emulating the speech styles of politicians. Each notebook focuses on specific tasks, such as training, generating, or analyzing text for individual politicians or debates.

## Files
- **Debate_de_RNNs.ipynb**: Simulates a political debate by combining text generation from multiple RNN models.
- **Pedro_Sanchez_RNN.ipynb**: Generates text based on Pedro Sánchez's speech style.
- **Pablo_Casado_RNN.ipynb**: Generates text based on Pablo Casado's speech style.
- **Santiago_Abascal_RNN.ipynb**: Generates text based on Santiago Abascal's speech style.

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilliusMahiae/RNN-Spanish-Government.git
cd RNN-Spanish-Government
```
Open any notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Run the notebooks to train models or generate text based on the desired political figure.
