# RNN-Spanish-Government
This project uses RNNs to generate Spanish texts emulating the speech styles of politicians. It includes LSTM models, optimization techniques, and metric-based evaluations (BLEU, Perplexity). The goal is to simulate coherent political dialogues and explore AI in linguistic contexts.
